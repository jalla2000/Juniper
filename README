How to compile
==============================================================

To compile, you need to have several libraies installed. To
compile an application using libspotify, you also need an
application key defined in a file called appkey.c

TODO: info about obtaining application keys

After a fresh install of Ubuntu 9.04/9.10, you'll need to
install the following packages to compile Juniper:

libqt4-dev
build-essential
libasound-dev
libsndfile-dev (the version in the repo is too old)
libspotify (download from http://developer.spotify.com)
TODO: libogg is also probably needed
lame

Juniper will compile without lame, but will gracefully fail to
create mp3-files at runtime.

Running the configure.sh script will download and install
libspotify (if not detected), and generate a Makefile.

Running './configure all' will also try to install needed
packages.

When the libraries and the application key are in place,
simply run:
./configure.sh
make

Then simply run:
./juniper
