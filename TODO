- Soundworker needs to be reworked:
  - Playing times are calculated based on the _streaming_, not the playback
    On fast connections the info slider easily runs twice as fast as it should
  - We should signal when playback is over. This can be used to skip to the
    next song
  - Implement seeking
  - Save/load the latest searches
  - Display search suggestions and allow searching for them
  - add UI to input username/password
